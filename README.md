Polymer Finance
===============

A set of polymer components to use in finance applications. I have deliberately kept styling to a minimum so you can 
use your own styles. I am only focusing on functionality.

##Options trading application (demo.html)
This is a demo of the various components working together in a fictitious financial trading platform

###Vanilla options input
Returns a json object in a promise representing a Vanilla option. If no data is passed will be in create mode and resolve promise when clicking add. If json representing option is passed
then will populate fields and resolve promise when editing is done.

###Money input
Extends useful behaviour over an input to work with money
